Cher's Wardrobe is a recreation of Cher Horowitz's iconic outfit-selecting program depicted in the opening scene of the 1995 cult classic Clueless. It is a ReactJS application that uses Redux to asynchronously fetch its data from a Rails API backend. 

## Prerequisites

## Instructions
1. Visit the [Cher's API](https://github.com/dalmaboros/chers-api) git repository and follow the README file instructions.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. In your terminal navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` then `npm start`.
4. If the browser does not open automatically, navigate to https://localhost:4000/.
